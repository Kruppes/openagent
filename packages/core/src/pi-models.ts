/**
 * Replacement for the deprecated `@earendil-works/pi-ai/compat` free functions
 * `streamSimple`/`completeSimple`. That entrypoint is explicitly temporary
 * ("This module is deleted with the coding-agent ModelManager migration"), so
 * every streaming/completion call site goes through the shared `Models`
 * collection built here instead.
 *
 * Invariants — do not break these:
 *
 *  1. `createModels()` is called WITHOUT `credentials`, `modelsStore` or
 *     `authContext`. The shared instance must never own credentials. With an
 *     empty (default in-memory) credential store, the SDK-internal OAuth
 *     refresh path (`resolveStoredOAuth`) is unreachable dead code, so it can
 *     never race our own serialised refresh in
 *     `provider-config.ts#refreshOAuthCredentialsLocked`. Handing this instance
 *     a credential store would resurrect that path and re-open the rotating
 *     refresh-token reuse-detection failure mode.
 *  2. OAuth lives exclusively in `provider-config.ts`. Credentials are resolved
 *     there (async, from the encrypted `providers.json`) and handed in per
 *     request.
 *  3. Every call site MUST pass a non-empty `options.apiKey`. `resolveProviderAuth`
 *     short-circuits on an explicit `apiKey` before touching the credential
 *     store, and `applyAuth` forwards it verbatim. Keyless providers (local
 *     Ollama) pass the `'no-key'` dummy from `getApiKeyForProvider`. Without a
 *     key the request surfaces as `stopReason: 'error'` with
 *     "Provider is not configured: <id>" rather than reaching the network.
 *
 * Setup failures are turned into an assistant message carrying
 * `stopReason: 'error'` + `errorMessage` (see `api/lazy.js`); they are neither
 * thrown nor swallowed, so call sites keep their existing error handling.
 */

/**
 * Wire-API implementations we can reach. Covers every `apiType` used by
 * `PROVIDER_TYPE_PRESETS` (`openai-completions`, `anthropic-messages`,
 * `mistral-conversations`, `google-generative-ai`, `openai-codex-responses`)
 * plus `openai-responses`, which catalog models behind Copilot/OpenCode-style
 * gateways can point at. Deliberately omits `pi-messages`, `google-vertex`,
 * `azure-openai-responses` and `bedrock-converse-stream`: they are unreachable
 * from our presets. Adding one is a single line here.
 *
 * Values are lazy `ProviderStreams` factories, so an API module is only loaded
 * once a request actually dispatches to it.
